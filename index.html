      <h3>Avatar: The Last Airbender</h3>
       <p>This is one of my favorite anime series. The plot is that this noob of an avatar must learn to control his power to stop the Fire Nation(basically the nazis) before they reach their goal. Which is world domination.</p>

      <h1>Hello I'm Jesus Ceballos</h1>
      <p>I'm a simpleton from Fillmore, CA. I don't do much . I just like to eat, sleep, and play video games. I also do Water Polo, but I'm a noob so I'm not in a Rio Mesa level. I have three siblings(two sisters and one brother). I love them ,but I don't like a few things about them. For example, my brother, since he still won't let me play the new Legend of Zelda game. My sisters also have their faults. They just like to yell and boss people around. They're sort of like Mexican Leslie Knopes. Then there are my parents. I love them, but I just don't want to be best friends with them. I also have a little forever puppy (a forever puppy is a dog that stays small forever). He likes to fight, bite ,and beg for food. Also his poops will kill an elephant from two miles away. Well, that's enough background information. It is now time for me to introduce you to a few of my most things in the world (currently).</p>

      <h3>Rubik's Cube</h3>
       <p>These are Rubik's cube puzzles, and, thanks to YouTube, it's easy to solve. I still can't solve it under thirty seconds though.</p>

      <h3>The Legend of Zelda</h3>
       <p>This is the greatest game series Nintendo has ever created (no it isn't Super Mario Bros.). It'll take five hours to try to explain the plot to you so, to learn about one of the best games in the series, click the link below.</p>

      <h3>Wii U </h3>
       <p>This is the Wii U. It's a console that can play both Wii and Wii U games on, and you can download classics. Also, the console doesn't have any games that have blood or gore. Just the way my mom likes it.</p>
